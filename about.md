# Who Are We?

Overall Investment Approach
Our overall investment strategy and specialty is to purchase distressed properties at a deep discount – usually 30% to 50% below market value, and renovate and sell those properties to retail homebuyers and landlords.

At REAITeam, we pride ourselves on having a strong foundation of real estate knowledge and training. Our focus is on providing SOLUTIONS for homeowners and finding VALUE for our buyers and investors by locating ugly, vacant homes that are eye sores and we put them back into use after renovation.

In addition, we re-develop a large number of single family and multi-family properties throughout the state with the intention of revitalizing communities and encouraging home ownership. Our mission is to rejuvenate neighborhoods and increase the standard of living by improving the overall quality of housing for the residents. 

## Our Mission

When a passion for real estate is combined with talented individuals who have an uncompromising drive to succeed, amazing things will happen. At [Your business name here], it’s our goal to not only have a positive effect on ourselves and our families - but also to inspire, motivate and create lasting change in everyone we encounter. We will treat our clients and team members with respect at all times. One of our motto’s  is “How you do anything is how you do everything.” Our company will dedicate itself to everlasting education and professional growth that will make the leaders of tomorrow.

## Our Business Model

Our core business lies within our systems, education and knowledge of the real estate industry. We did not just buy a CD off the Internet and become a real estate investor overnight. We have spent thousands of dollars to learn how to be successful in this business and do it the right way the first time. Through our affiliation, we are connected with a national network of investors that provide continual support and weekly trainings on changes throughout our industry. This process has allowed us to circumvent many pitfalls most novice investors would make. Learning the hard way is not a phrase in our vocabulary, and we certainly would not ask anyone to invest with us if we weren’t confident enough to invest ourselves!

### We Follow A Strict Due Diligence Process

We have a systematic and disciplined approach when purchasing investment properties, putting each potential investment through a strict due diligence process. This rigorous set of criteria includes, but is not limited to, the following:
- Comparable property analysis and examination by an certified, independent appraiser
- An economic study of the neighborhood, city planning and development
- Demographics of area, marketability, and growth potential
- Statistics on the crime rate
- Public transportation and schools
- Overall condition of the property, including heating and air, plumbing, electrical, roof and structural condition

## What's Our Competitive Advantage?

Most homeowners have no idea what options are available to them beyond listing a house with a real estate agent or just trying to sell the house on their own, and hope for the best. We provide homeowners with a unique alternative to listing their house on their own or with a real estate agent. Our “out of the box” creative approach to real estate investing is a cut above the rest.

Our company can acquire great deals on properties because we have the ability to act quickly and can close with CASH on the seller’s timeline. This is why we can buy properties at such a discount, sometimes in a matter of days. We have a competitive advantage over other investors who sometimes take weeks to purchase properties, and can create extremely fast and hassle-free transactions. 

We have an aggressive TEAM approach, and a top-notch ability to expand our client base through our knowledge of deal structuring and advanced real estate techniques.

We also employ marketing strategies as soon as we purchase a home – giving us a fair advantage over a real estate agent. Typically, many agents don’t spend time or money on marketing or lead generation strategies. As a result, it can sometimes take months to attract potential buyers. Often times, we are able to find our own buyers, allowing us to secure a strong sales price and save on sales commissions. 

Our renovation process is also down to a science with handpicked and proven construction crews who know we are not retail clients. We pay wholesale prices to all contractors and typically get bulk discounts on all materials. 

### Advantages to Working With Us

- We have the business systems and knowledge to purchase properties QUICKLY and with CASH
- We create value by finding ugly, vacant homes and putting them back into use after renovation
- We have a creative marketing system to find and purchase properties before they’re ever listed
- We pay wholesale prices to all contractors and typically get bulk discounts on all materials
- We find our own buyers quickly, allowing us to secure a strong sales price and save on sales commissions  

## Investment Buying Criteria

Our goal is to purchase distressed homes in stable areas where there is still strong buying demand. Part of our grand vision is to improve the overall quality of living in both urban and suburban neighborhoods. In addition to improving overall quality of life, we are committed to increasing the value of real estate in our community. We are able to target distressed properties and breathe new life back into them with highly-skilled renovations and improvements. By doing so, we are able to create beautiful homes and encourage home ownership.

The ability to identify a wise real estate investment is certainly a learned skill. We have been thoroughly trained and possess this skill - along with the intuition to spot these great investment opportunities in today’s market. 
 
Not every opportunity is a “good deal”, and we have built our company on a stable foundation knowing our numbers. Our goal is to be in business for many years and brand a company that will be passed down to our children, which cannot be accomplished by taking uncalculated risks.

## How Do We Purchase Homes So Far Below Market Value?

REAITeam, we have created a marketing machine that produces a consistent flow of high quality leads.

## How We Sell Properties Quickly

The problem is: they just don’t know how to identify and analyze them to ensure they are actually getting a good value. That’s where we come in. We are constantly on the hunt for the next great buying opportunity, and use proven techniques to analyze investment properties.
