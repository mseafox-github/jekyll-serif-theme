### How can we help?

> What Does A Real Estate Agent Do For A Seller?
- Homeowners looking to sell their homes turn to listing agents. Listing agents provide clients with an unbiased valuation of their home and help set a listing price. Real estate agents are in tune with the market, so they also make suggestions for home updates that will lead to a successful home sale.
- Listing agents also handle marketing a home listing. This includes entering the home into the local multiple listing service (MLS) database. Marketing is also done through networking with other real estate agents, and by creating advertisements and setting up open houses, among other methods.
- It’s vital for listing agents to vet buyers, too. Not everyone is a serious buyer. Listing agents often check on a potential buyer’s finances before arranging a showing or accepting an offer. Listing agents know the right questions to ask to find out if a prospective home buyer can afford to buy the home or not.
- Listing agents also negotiate various aspects of a home sale on behalf of their client. They may negotiate the price of the home or smaller expenses like closing costs, home warranties and any fees. There are legal actions that occur during the process of selling a home that fall on a real estate agent as well. Their job includes preparing, submitting and filing any documents, like contracts and agreements.

### How does this work?
Real estate agents are licensed professionals who organize real estate transactions between buyers and sellers. Agents who represent sellers are also called listing agents. Buyer’s agents are exactly what they sound like – they’re real estate agents who represent buyers.

You may also hear real estate agents referred to as REALTORS®. Real estate agents and REALTORS® perform the same essential functions, but REALTORS® are agents or brokers who are also members of the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR).

Real estate agents can be both listing agents and buyer’s agents, but typically not for the same real estate transaction. Real estate agents walk their clients through the entire home buying or selling process, providing valuable knowledge and information at each step.

Real estate agents are typically compensated by commission, which is a percentage of a property’s purchase price, otherwise known as REALTOR® fees.

> Important:
- Seller's agent will advise you on the listing price.
- Walk the client through any necessary paperwork.
- Communicate with the client and other parties involved.
- Provide information on the home inspection process.
- Continue to support the client through the closing process.
- One thing to keep in mind is that all real estate agents should be:
  - Familiar with the local housing market, including pricing.
  - Knowledgable on local and state real estate laws.
  - Understanding of their clients' needs.

### What role do agents play at closing?
Real estate agents also play a role during the closing period. Throughout the process, agents communicate between their client and the other party. Communication continues the entire time their clients are closing on a house. They may suggest a final walkthrough of the home close to the closing date. This allows you to check for any damage that has occurred since the initial contract.

Real estate agents also look over every document, ensuring accuracy and that all terms and conditions have been met before the home deed is transferred. Mistakes happen, and it’s an agent’s job to find and correct them before everything is finalized.

Agents also represent you at any meetings or contract signings. Several different parties can be involved in the closing process, depending on which state you’re in, including real estate attorneys, a title or escrow agent, a mortgage lender, sellers and buyers, and real estate agents. Agents represent their clients’ best interest not only until the sale is final, but also work to maintain a relationship.

### What happens if you don't have an agent?
If you’re selling a house yourself, all of the REALTOR® duties mentioned earlier become your responsibility. You’re in charge of listing your home, marketing it, setting up showings and open houses, providing necessary paperwork, negotiating price and working with the other party’s real estate agent. It’s a lot to oversee, especially if you don’t have the experience or knowledge of real estate transactions. It’s not impossible to represent yourself, but it’s a considerable time and energy commitment.
