**SELLER** looking to sell property with low prospect from traditional retail buyers, typically from the MLS (Multiple Listing Service). Meaning it has liens, needs repair, and/or for any number of reasons including, but not limited to pre-foreclosure or emergencies. The sale is not straightforward and therefore does not fit the traditional sale framework. And you still want the best price and fast.

### How can we help?
We are members of the largest real estate network in North America. We strive to get you the best price and fast.

### How does this work?
This strategy involves getting a property under contract with a long option period (typically 60-90 days) and then auctioning or otherwise marketing the property to potential buyers.
