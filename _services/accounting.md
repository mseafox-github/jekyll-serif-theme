**SELLER** looking to sell property with low prospect from traditional retail buyers, typically from the MLS (Multiple Listing Service). Meaning it has liens, needs repair, and/or for any number of reasons including, but not limited to pre-foreclosure or emergencies. The sale is not straightforward and therefore does not fit the traditional sale framework. And you still want the best price and fast.

### How can we help?
We are members of the largest real estate network in North America. We strive to get you the best price and fast.

### How does this work?
This strategy involves getting a property under contract with a long option period (typically 60-90 days) and then auctioning or otherwise marketing the property to potential buyers.

### Why work with us?
There are many methods we use to sell properties very quickly. We invest a lot of time and money into marketing to build a strong list of buyer clients for our homes. Despite what the media says, there are tons of buyers out there who are aware of the fact that numerous buying opportunities exist in today’s real estate market. The problem is: they just don’t know how to identify and analyze them to ensure they are actually getting a good value. That’s where we come in. We are constantly on the hunt for the next great buying opportunity, and use proven techniques to analyze investment properties.
