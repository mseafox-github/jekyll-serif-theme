**WHOLESALER**, we would like to work with you! With our vast network and highly experience team, we can handle volume and fast. We use artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to quickly analyze and run the numbers. We can give you an answer fast. We manage many portfolios from rentals to flips. If you got the **DEAL**, we got the **MONEY**.

### What are we looking for?
> Criteria:
- Land
- Residential
  - Single-family detached, duplex, multi-family.
- Commercial
  - Apartment, hotel, industrial, land, mixed use, office, retail, special purpose.

### Why work with us?
Our team can acquire great deals on properties because we have the ability to act quickly and can close with **CASH** on the seller’s timeline. This is why we can buy properties at such a discount, sometimes in a matter of days. We have a competitive advantage over other investors who sometimes take weeks to purchase properties, and can create extremely fast and hassle-free transactions. 

We have an aggressive TEAM approach, and a top-notch ability to expand our client base through our knowledge of deal structuring and advanced real estate techniques.

We also employ marketing strategies as soon as we purchase a home – giving us a fair advantage over a real estate agent. Typically, many agents don’t spend time or money on marketing or lead generation strategies. As a result, it can sometimes take months to attract potential buyers. Often times, we are able to find our own buyers, allowing us to secure a strong sales price and save on sales commissions. 

Our renovation process is also down to a science with handpicked and proven construction crews who know we are not retail clients. We pay wholesale prices to all contractors and typically get bulk discounts on all materials.
