### How can we help?

> What Does A Real Estate Agent Do For A Buyer?
- Buyer’s agents search for local properties that match their client’s requirements and price range. This involves searching online but also scouting houses in person. We also set up showings and inform clients on the local area and housing market.
- Real estate agents make sure clients are preapproved for a mortgage. Being preapproved shows your agent, the homeowners and their agents that you’re serious about buying a house.
- Once you’ve found a house you’re interested in, real estate agents help submit bids and negotiate on your behalf throughout the buying process.
- Real estate agents also help set up home appraisals and inspections. We have existing relationships with reputable people in the industry who provide those services.
- There’s a lot of paperwork that occurs during the home buying process. It’s a real estate agent's job to guide you through all of the contracts, agreements and other documents necessary when buying a home. They also are the ones who submit paperwork on your behalf.
- From first contact to closing, your real estate agent is your connection to all parties involved when buying a house.

### How does this work?
Real estate agents are licensed professionals who organize real estate transactions between buyers and sellers. Agents who represent sellers are also called listing agents. Buyer’s agents are exactly what they sound like – they’re real estate agents who represent buyers.

You may also hear real estate agents referred to as REALTORS®. Real estate agents and REALTORS® perform the same essential functions, but REALTORS® are agents or brokers who are also members of the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR).

Real estate agents can be both listing agents and buyer’s agents, but typically not for the same real estate transaction. Real estate agents walk their clients through the entire home buying or selling process, providing valuable knowledge and information at each step.

Real estate agents are typically compensated by commission, which is a percentage of a property’s purchase price, otherwise known as REALTOR® fees.

> Important:
- Hiring a buyer's agent won't cost you a dime. Buyer's agent don't get paid by the buyer. They get paid by the seller. Typically, the buyer's agent and the seller's agent will split the commission on a home sale.
- Buyer's agent will advise you on what to offer.
- Buyer's agent can also advise you on financing and even help you find a lender.
- Walk the client through any necessary paperwork.
- Communicate with the client and other parties involved.
- Provide information on the home inspection process.
- Continue to support the client through the closing process.
- One thing to keep in mind is that all real estate agents should be:
  - Familiar with the local housing market, including pricing.
  - Knowledgable on local and state real estate laws.
  - Understanding of their clients' needs.

### What role do agents play at closing?
Real estate agents also play a role during the closing period. Throughout the process, agents communicate between their client and the other party. Communication continues the entire time their clients are closing on a house. They may suggest a final walkthrough of the home close to the closing date. This allows you to check for any damage that has occurred since the initial contract.

Real estate agents also look over every document, ensuring accuracy and that all terms and conditions have been met before the home deed is transferred. Mistakes happen, and it’s an agent’s job to find and correct them before everything is finalized.

Agents also represent you at any meetings or contract signings. Several different parties can be involved in the closing process, depending on which state you’re in, including real estate attorneys, a title or escrow agent, a mortgage lender, sellers and buyers, and real estate agents. Agents represent their clients’ best interest not only until the sale is final, but also work to maintain a relationship.

### What happens if you don't have an agent?
If you’re buying a house yourself, all of the REALTOR® duties mentioned earlier become your responsibility. You’ll submit bids, negotiate pricing, line up inspections and handle all of the legal tasks associated with buying a home. It’s a lot to oversee, especially if you don’t have the experience or knowledge of real estate transactions. It’s not impossible to represent yourself, but it’s a considerable time and energy commitment.
