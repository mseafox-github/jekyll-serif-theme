### Who is this for?

- Down payment: The tenant will finish the lease term with a considerable down payment saved by simply paying rent.
- Convenience: Rather than move again, the tenant can offset those moving expenses and hassle by simply buying the home they’re already renting.
- Credit score: If the buyer doesn’t have a qualifying credit score for a mortgage, a lease purchase agreement can give the buyer time to repair their credit score or other credit problems while working towards homeownership.

### How does this work?
Property goes under lease with an understanding that at the end of the lease period, the tenant will receive the deed to the property from the seller. In the case of a lease option, you, the buyer can simply choose not to exercise the option to buy the property and walk away from the transaction. The landlord keeps the option fee and can rent or try and sell to someone else at the end of your lease term.

## Lease Option vs Contract Deed
### How a lease option works
Property goes under lease (3 year lease) with an option to buy the property at a pre-negotiated price (often the loan balance) sometime over the next 3 years.

Lease options tend to leave the buyer off the hook if they do not want to continue the transaction. A lease option contract for a home is both a standard lease and an option contract to buy the house. You begin by performing the typical procedure of any rental, filling out a lease with the seller/landlord. If you decide not to exercise your option to purchase according to the contract, the landlord keeps the option fee and can rent or try and sell to someone else at the end of your lease term.

Keep in mind that those who are renting a home are able to learn a great deal about homeownership during the rental period. This may include information about maintaining the landscaping of the property and dealing with conflicts with neighbors. Some renters are not quite sure they are ready to handle all of these issues and may use a lease option agreement as a trial period to determine whether or not homeownership suits them.

### How a contract deed works
Property goes under lease (10-30 year lease) with an understanding that at the end of the lease period, the tenant will receive the deed to the property from the seller.
