Real estate agents are licensed professionals who organize real estate transactions between buyers and sellers. Agents who represent sellers are also called listing agents. Buyer’s agents are exactly what they sound like – they’re real estate agents who represent buyers.

You may also hear real estate agents referred to as REALTORS®. Real estate agents and REALTORS® perform the same essential functions, but REALTORS® are agents or brokers who are also members of the National Association of REALTORS® (NAR).

Real estate agents can be both listing agents and buyer’s agents, but typically not for the same real estate transaction. Real estate agents walk their clients through the entire home buying or selling process, providing valuable knowledge and information at each step.

Real estate agents are typically compensated by commission, which is a percentage of a property’s purchase price, otherwise known as REALTOR® fees.

### How can we help?

> What Does A Real Estate Agent Do For A Buyer?
- Buyer’s agents search for local properties that match their client’s requirements and price range. This involves searching online but also scouting houses in person. We also set up showings and inform clients on the local area and housing market.

- Real estate agents make sure clients are preapproved for a mortgage. Being preapproved shows your agent, the homeowners and their agents that you’re serious about buying a house.

- Once you’ve found a house you’re interested in, real estate agents help submit bids and negotiate on your behalf throughout the buying process.

- Real estate agents also help set up home appraisals and inspections. We have existing relationships with reputable people in the industry who provide those services.

- There’s a lot of paperwork that occurs during the home buying process. It’s a real estate agent's job to guide you through all of the contracts, agreements and other documents necessary when buying a home. They also are the ones who submit paperwork on your behalf.

- From first contact to closing, your real estate agent is your connection to all parties involved when buying a house.
