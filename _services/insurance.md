**SELLER** with financial difficulties. Selling the property for less than what is owe on the mortgage. Financially distressed homeowner needs to sell the property before the lender seizes it in a foreclosure.

All of the proceeds of a short sale go to the lender. The lender then has two options—to forgive the remaining balance or to pursue a deficiency judgment that requires the former homeowner to pay the lender all or part of the difference. In some states, this difference in price must be forgiven.

## Foreclosure vs Short Sale
A short sale or foreclosure are two possible outcomes for homeowners who are behind on their mortgage payments, own a home that is underwater, or both. In either case, the owner is forced to part with the home, but the timeline and consequences are different.

### How a foreclosure works
In a foreclosure, the lender seizes the home after the borrower fails to make payments. Unlike a short sale, a foreclosure is initiated by the lender alone. Foreclosure is the last option for the lender.

In such cases, the lender repossesses the home, hoping to eventually make good on its investment in the mortgage. Unlike in most short sales, many foreclosures take place after the homeowner abandons the home. If the occupants are still in the home, they are evicted by the lender.

Once the lender has access to the home, it orders an appraisal and puts it up for sale.

Foreclosures normally take less time to complete because the lender wants to liquidate the asset quickly. Foreclosed homes may even be auctioned off at a public trustee sale.

Depending on the circumstances, homeowners who experience foreclosure have to wait for two to seven years to purchase another home. A foreclosure is kept on a person’s credit report for seven years.

### How a short sale works
A distressed homeowner generally gets to stay in the home during the short sale process.

A homeowner who has gone through a short sale may, with certain restrictions, be eligible to purchase another home immediately.

While a foreclosure essentially lets you walk away from your home—albeit with grave consequences for your financial future, such as having to declare bankruptcy and destroying your credit. Completing a short sale is labor-intensive. However, the payoff for the extra work involved in a short sale may be worth it.

> Important:
- If you are facing foreclosure, or have lost your home through foreclosure, you might still owe your mortgage lender money after the sale. This happens if the foreclosure sale price is less than the amount remaining on your mortgage - it's called a "deficiency."
- Deficiencies play a role in short sales too. In most states, you are on the hook for a deficiency after a short sale. But there are ways you can avoid or handle a deficiency.
- And for foreclosures, short sales, and deeds in lieu of foreclosure, you might owe the IRS some money if the lender forgives the deficiency
- Less drastic alternatives to a short sale include loan modification or the use of private mortgage insurance.
